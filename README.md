    rm -rf ~/.themes/{Arc-Flatabulous,Arc-Flatabulous-Darker,Arc-Flatabulous-Dark}

#### Packages

Arch Linux users can install the theme from the AUR https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gtk-arc-flatabulous-theme-git/
	
#### Manual Installation

To build the theme you'll need 
* `autoconf`
* `automake`
* `pkg-config` or `pkgconfig` if you use Fedora
* `libgtk-3-dev` for Debian based distros or `gtk3-devel` for RPM based distros
* `git` if you want to clone the source directory


Pre-step
Make sure to install all build dependencies,
If dependencies not installed, you can use command below
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake pkg-config libgtk-3-dev (Ubuntu and Derivatives)


If your distributions doesn't ship separate development packages you just need GTK 3 instead of the `-dev` packages.

Install the theme with the following commands

**1. Get the source**

If you want to install the latest version from git, clone the repository with

    git clone https://github.com/andreisergiu98/arc-flatabulous-theme && cd arc-flatabulous-theme

**2. Build and install the theme**

    ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
    sudo make install

Other options to pass to autogen.sh are

    --disable-transparency     disable transparency in the GTK3 theme
    --disable-light            disable Arc Light support
    --disable-darker           disable Arc Darker support

    --with-gnome=<version>     build the theme for a specific Gnome version (3.14, 3.16, 3.18, 3.20)
                               Note: Normally the correct version is detected automatically and this
                               option should not be needed.

After the installation is complete you can activate the theme with `gnome-tweak-tool` or a similar program by selecting `Arc-Flatabulous`, `Arc-Flatabulous-Darker` or `Arc-Flatabulous-Dark` as Window/GTK+ theme and `Arc-Flatabulous` or `Arc-Flatabulous-Dark` as Gnome-Shell and Xfce-Notify theme.

### Troubleshooting

If you have Ubuntu with a newer GTK/Gnome version than the one included by default (i.e Ubuntu 14.04 with GTK 3.14 or Ubuntu 15.04 with GTK 3.16, etc.) the prebuilt packages won't work properly and you have to install the theme manually as described above.
This is also true for other distros with a different GTK/Gnome version than the one included by default

If you get artifacts like black or invisible backgrounds under Unity, disable overlay scrollbars with

    gsettings set com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode normal
